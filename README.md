# Horiseon Refacted Code
## Description

In altering the Horiseon website, my goal was to exemplify my capabilities with regards to refacting code. The code was presented to me in a state of dissaray, and needed updating in respect to organization, accessibility, and order. The goal of this project was to:

  1. Update the semantic structure of the HTML elements
  2. Add alt attributes to images
  3. Present all elements in a logical flow
  4. Ensure heading attributes fall in a sequential order
  5. Consolidate extraneous style selectors and descriptors
  6. Ensure the Horiseon website remained in-tact throughout this process

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
